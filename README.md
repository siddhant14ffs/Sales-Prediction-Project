# Sales-Prediction-Project
I developed a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data using Python in Google Colab.
The workflow included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering. 
I implemented various regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, to forecast future sales.
Model performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score. 
The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies.
