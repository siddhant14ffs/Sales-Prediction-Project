# Sales-Prediction-Project
- I developed a machine learning model to predict sales based on historical data using Python in Google Colab.
- The workflow included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering.
- I implemented various regression models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, to forecast future sales.
- Model performance was evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R² score.
- The project demonstrates how predictive analytics can help businesses make data-driven decisions to improve sales strategies.
